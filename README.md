I wanted to be able to make use of Sonoff devices as is with a low memory usage for Homey.
So without the need to solder things and update it's firmware.

This has the downside that you will be required to keep the Sonoff in lan-mode and give it a fixed IP address.
Since you cannot do either from the Sonoff you will need to be able to do so in your router.

That's where it gets hard, since many routers won't let you set fixed IP addresses based on MAC addresses.
If you can set that up, then this app might just be the perfect Homey Sonoff app for you.
